# Superb Ecommerce Storefront
An e-commerce web app that let the users view a product details page. We were given an API that contained all the data that we need, but the product and structure of the web app is up to us to decided.

One constraint of the project was that we must limit the use of external libraries to the bare minimum and implement everything from scratch.

The web app composed of three main modules:
- Product Overview
- Questions & Answers
- Ratings & Breakdown
